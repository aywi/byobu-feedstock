    otherwise functional, plain, practical GNU Screen, for the Ubuntu server
    distribution. Byobu now includes an enhanced profiles, convenient
    keybindings, configuration utilities, and toggle-able system status
    notifications for both the GNU Screen window manager and the more modern
    Tmux terminal multiplexer, and works on most Linux, BSD, and Mac
    distributions.
