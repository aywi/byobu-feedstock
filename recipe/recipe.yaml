about:
  summary: Text-based window manager and terminal multiplexer
  description: |
    Byobu is a GPLv3 open source text-based window manager and terminal
    multiplexer. It was originally designed to provide elegant enhancements to
    the otherwise functional, plain, practical GNU Screen, for the Ubuntu server
    distribution. Byobu now includes an enhanced profiles, convenient
    keybindings, configuration utilities, and toggle-able system status
    notifications for both the GNU Screen window manager and the more modern
    Tmux terminal multiplexer, and works on most Linux, BSD, and Mac distributions.
